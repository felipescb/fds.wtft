		By leveraging three different models of crowdfunding (classical, recurring and matchfunding) Benfeitoria' social-impact is almost immeasurable.	 Between the time operating the crowdfunding platform, we also develop projects where we can foster our worldviews: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/riomais.vc" target="_blank">RIO+</a>, <a href="https://ufc.benfeitoria.com/" target="_blank">the brazillian university of crowdfunding (UFC)</a>, <a href="reboot.benfeitoria.com" target="_blank">the Reboot Fest</a> and more.  Benfeitoria, at the moment, keep with the <a href="https://benfeitoria.com/queermuseu" target="_blank">brazillian record of crowdfunding</a> and the biggest success rate between the biggest platforms in Brazil (75% of the projects get 100% of the goal).

		During the last 4 years I've been colaborated more than intensely with Benfeitoria in areas such as software enginnering, devops, growth hacking, bussiness/communication/data strategy while holding great achiviments, hapiness and sorrows.
