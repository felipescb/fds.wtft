		It was another sunny day in Rio de Janeiro, and as always, after class I would meet my friend Daniel for our traditional Parkour training. We walked from school to our homes, we were very methodical and we always did the same route, but whenever we went to practice one of Parkour's most classic vaults: King Kong * I failed miserably ... days and days trying and always locking
		<br>
		<br>
		And it was on a Tuesday night that I discovered a method for practicing any vault without leaving home. Lying in my bed, immersed in the world of dreams, that by recognizing patterns in the different reality that is a dream I migrated to a lucid dream. Navigating through it I had an insight that changed my way of seeing this tool, which once served as a great moment of infinite entertainment.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the blink of an eye I changed the scenery of the dream to the one that I practiced Parkour every day, I went there, in the same obstacle and made King Kong a few times - in the ambience of the lucid dream, where everything was in control, it happened as if I knew to do since I was a child. And the next day was no different, he left the class, met my friend and we followed the same course and without hesitation made the King Kong perfectly.
		<br><br>
		After all, I already knew I could do it.

		Since a kid, I've being having constantly lucid dreams without knowing exactly what are they, after discovering through a movie and post research, dreams, lucid dreams and now dream yoga re constantly subject of my own personal research.
