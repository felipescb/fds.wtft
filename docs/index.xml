      <description>The Cached Collective is an international group of creatives of diverse backgrounds, who are dedicated to exploring how technology influences our individual lived realities. Because of the impenetrable way that modern technology functions, we strive to design impactful experiences that can be easily understood by a wide audience. We make the intangible tangible. We create impactful experiences that delve into data, algorithmic complexity, and obscure infrastructure, especially focusing on how these affect the individual.</description>

      <description>Benfeitoria is an innovation laboratory that was born to foster a more humane, collaborative and maker culture in Brazil.     By leveraging three different models of crowdfunding (classical, recurring and matchfunding) Benfeitoria&#39; social-impact is almost immeasurable. Between the time operating the crowdfunding platform, we also develop projects where we can foster our worldviews: RIO+, the brazillian university of crowdfunding (UFC), the Reboot Fest and more. Benfeitoria, at the moment, keep with the brazillian record of crowdfunding and the biggest success rate between the biggest platforms in Brazil (75% of the projects get 100% of the goal).</description>
