        The Cached Collective is an international group of creatives of diverse backgrounds, who are dedicated to exploring how technology influences our individual lived realities. Because of the impenetrable way that modern technology functions, we strive to design impactful experiences that can be easily understood by a wide audience. We make the intangible tangible. We create impactful experiences that delve into data, algorithmic complexity, and obscure infrastructure, especially focusing on how these affect the individual. — More info at <a href="//www.cached.id" target='_blank'>www.cached.id</a>

        The Cached experience takes a physical approach to personal digital data. The project engages with the repercussions of our individual online presence. Our online personality is cached, used to create a digital model of each of us to learn as much as possible. The Cached experience gives you a glimpse at how algorithms have learned to view us and the assumptions they make about us.

        Using IBM Watson and Cambridge Apply Magic Sauce, your social media personality is analysed and quantified, generating a psychological profile that describes your personality, behaviours, and predilections. This information takes the form of an immersive narrative accompanied by an audiovisual experience, to illustrate just how your activities online contribute to the way in which machines see you.

        We are looking to further explore this framework and harness it to engage more deeply with the functions, purposes and deployments of sophisticated algorithms. We want to continue creating evocative experiences that raise awareness about the complications that arise due to our increasingly technologised lives.

        The project is a result of a collaborative effort by the Cached Collective. The collective first met during a summer residency in the South of France, the Hive. Each of us brings a distinct expertise to our collaborations that we leverage to create unique, multidisciplinary experiences. This broad base of specialities—from engineering to fashion design, from poetry to programming—allows us to approach our topics with a unique eye.
